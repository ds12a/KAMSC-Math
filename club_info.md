The KAMSC Math Team will meet in **Mr. Alshehri's room** on Wednesday's from **insert time** to **insert time**

Practices will be held weekly along with competitions that will be spread out throughout the year. See the schedule page for more information about this.

A typical practice will consist students splitting up into smaller groups and then each group receiving a problem set with problems similar to those that would appear on contests. Teams will attempt to score higher than others and at the end, people can share their solutions to problems that they solved. Problems that no one solved will ultimately be explained at the end of practice.

While the problem sets are being graded, **snacks will be provided**. 


# Team Selection 

Because a large majority of the math competitions that the team will participate in require teams of up to 4-6 ppl, our overall team will be separated into A and B teams (and more depending on size). The KAMSC A and KAMSC B teams will both be chosen mainly through AMC10 / AMC12 scores (however practices are also taken into consideration). Because the AMC12 is noticeably more difficult than the AMC10, club leaders will take into account this difference and weight the scores accordingly. However, the difficulty of qualifying for AIME is the same regardless of whether students take the AMC10 or AMC12. Because so few students qualify for the AIME, all AIME qualifiers are then automatically placed on the A team. 

Please note that both A and B teams will both be able to participate in all the same contests, with the only difference being who your team members are (as well as your team name). Certain competitions might require the A and B teams to compete in separate divisions, however both teams will still compete either ways. 

# Commitment

It is generally expected that students try to show up to all the competitions throughout the year as well as practices specifically after teams have been chosen. With their teams, students can organize practice times outside of the practices already set up, as well as prepare individually for these competitions. Because of this, students more serious about the team (specifically those on the A team) should expect **around 1-3 hours per week** spent on preparing for competitions as well as attending practice. It is completely fine and understandable if you can't attend a practice or a competition, but do try and let your team know ahead of time while also letting the club leaders know so we can make arrangements accordingly. 

During formal practices, groups will be separated such that all group members are from the same team, that way students are able to practice with their actual team members.
