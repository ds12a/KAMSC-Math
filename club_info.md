The KAMSC Math Team will meet in **Mr. Alshehri's room** on Wednesday's from **insert time** to **insert time**

Practices will be held weekly along with competitions that will be spread out throughout the year. See the schedule page for more information about this.

A typical practice will consist students splitting up into smaller groups and then each group receiving a problem set with problems similar to those that would appear on contests. Teams will attempt to score higher than others and at the end, people can share their solutions to problems that they solved. Problems that no one solved will ultimately be explained at the end of practice.

While the problem sets are being graded, **snacks will be provided**.
