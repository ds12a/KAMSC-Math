The KAMSC Math Team will meet in **Mr. Alshehri's room** on Wednesday's during **open lab (6:00 - 7:30 after school)**. 

Practices will be held weekly along with competitions that will be spread out throughout the year. See the schedule page for more information about this. During practice, students will work on problems typically with other students in small groups, with internal "competitions" between these groups hosted just for the fun of it. And yes, **Snacks will be provided**.

# Team Selection 

If, at any point, it is required to sort out a ranking or select certain students / teams, selection will be done based off of AMC10/12 scores. Certain competitions might require groups of teams (for example they might require teams of size 4), limit us to a certain number of teams, or require some sort of ranking of our teams.

# Commitment

It is generally expected that students try to show up to all the competitions throughout the year as well as practices specifically after teams have been chosen. With their teams, students can organize practice times outside of the practices already set up, as well as prepare individually for these competitions. Because of this, students more serious about the team (specifically those on the A team) should expect **around 1-3 hours per week** spent on preparing for competitions as well as attending practice. It is completely fine and understandable if you can't attend a practice or a competition, but do try and let your team know ahead of time while also letting the club leaders know so we can make arrangements accordingly. 

During formal practices, groups will be separated such that all group members are from the same team, that way students are able to practice with their actual team members.
